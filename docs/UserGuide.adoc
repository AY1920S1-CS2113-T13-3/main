# Chronologer User Guide

## 1. Introduction
Chronologer is a task manager designed for students to handle convoluted and unclear management of module information frequently faced throughout the semester. It is optimized for those who are familiar with Command Line Interfaces(CLI) and even has a GUI that displays clear and intuitive information.
With Chronologer, students no longer have to fret about lagging behind in their work and continue to be on top of their taskings.

- [/by <INDEX_OF_DEADLINE>] can be omitted, the Scheduling feature will instead find all free periods for the Todo up to a hard-limit of 30 days from the present time.

If at least one free period has been found, Chronologer will display, in chronological order, all periods that the user can do the Todo in while still complying with the Deadline.

If no free period could be found, Chronologer will inform the user that no period long enough to complete the Todo could be found and suggests the user to consider freeing up their schedule.

Example input:
`schedule 6 /by 4`

Example output:
`You can schedule this task from now till 08/11/2019 1400`

### 3.6.2) Schedule a todo with duration by a date

Likewise in 3.6.1, Chronologer will display the results to the user based on there are any free periods of time or not.

Example input:
`schedule 6 /by 08/08/2019 0800`
